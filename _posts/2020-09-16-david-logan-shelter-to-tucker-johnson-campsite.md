miles: 11.6

it was pretty cold last night, but i'm happy to report that the new insulated sleeping pad worked a treat. i woke up pretty early but lounged around due to the cold. magz and i didn't hit the trail til 09:00hr.

the day was cool and breezy, but sunny. again, my puffy was on most of the day. we passed another snowmobile trail, again with a thermometer that read 48f.

this particular section of trail is relatively flat deciduous forest. the terrain doesn't allow for many views, but there was at least one due to some recent tree clearing.

we tried for rolston rest shelter for lunch and thought we were on track, but at 12:30 we were still 2 miles away, and pretty much out of water. we opted to lunch in a small pine stand on the trail.

after lunch we made it to rolston and refilled our water. we knew tucker johnson wouldn't have water, but opted not to camel up and instead relied on some guthook comments mentioning water .4 and .9 miles north.

the .9 miles north water source, which was supposedly a full stream was a bust. thankfully at around .4 we found some small streams and filled all available vessels.

the campsite has a pretty new shelter, so it's no longer aptly named. there were two other folks and their dog at the site already.

we set up camp and chatted with the neighbors over dinner before retiring to bed. dinner was good to go bibimbap, and it was great. definitely one to get again!

not a particularly exciting day on trail as it was the infamous green tunnel all day and not a lot else, but it was nice moving slowly through the world with magz.
