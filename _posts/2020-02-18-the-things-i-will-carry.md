i might as well start off with the obligatory gear post. the more i look into planning my 2020 through hike, the more i realize it's going to go out the window minutes after i depart. currently my plan is to show up at springer mountain with my gear and 4 days of food. (i ran this plan by "bus driver" who thought the plan was good, except she advised that i only needed 3 days of food, and no rain pants.)

i'm used to carrying a 65-70# mountaineering style pack. in the middle of alaska or wyoming if your boots wear out, you're not getting another pair easily. in those instances choosing more durable (read: heavier) gear makes some sense. since resupply is infrequent you must carry a lot more days of food. you also tend to carry a lot more in the way of first aid and repair. the AT is a very different type of hike. being able to resupply every 3-5 days or get new gear in a couple days has it's perks. additionally, my prior back country experiences topped out at 6 weeks. 6 weeks at any weight doesn't take the same toll on your joints and ligaments as 4-6 months of relatively high daily mileage.
