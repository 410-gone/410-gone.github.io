miles: 12.6

pretty cold night last night. though i didn't see it, there were reports of frost. rags had a rough night. she was up many times running to the privy for digestive issues. thankfully no accidents.

we decided to pack up and get on trail without breakfast. 4.2 miles down trail was griffith lake which we hoped would have some sun by the time we got there. we each ate a snack and got moving. getting on trail really helped to keep out the morning cold. it tends to seep in as you're sitting waiting for water to boil.

we stopped briefly at baker peak to take in the view before continuing down to griffith lake.

the spot a griffith lake had one sunny corner that was just enough for us to squeeze into. we made our breakfast while numerous weekend campers from the nearby campsite filtered water.

we discovered that rags' food bag was infiltrated by mice. they chewed a hole in it, and a bag of granola and made off with almost 3/4 of it. not wanting to pack out food, i spread it onto a bandana to check for poop (there was none) before boiling it thoroughly and eating it. scrumptious.

three hikers that camped next to us at lost pond shelter showed up for their morning break, and headed off. we filtered water and packed up and passed them a few minutes later at a brook also filtering water.

we hiked up peru peak where there is no view and then across to styles peak where we stopped for lunch. the small outcropping that afforded a view had a number of people on it - too many really. we finished up and headed out, but not before learning that literally every single bear hang at lost pond shelter (except mine) had a hole chewed in it and food stolen by mice.

we hiked down to mad tom notch rd, and started up bromley mountain. rags almost stepped on a giant spotted salamander crossing the trail. sadly it was dark and the photo is all blurry.

we reached the top a little over an hour after leaving mad tom notch road. we checked out the ski patrol hut at the top. i hadn't done it on the way to canada because i passed early in the morning and it was full of people. there was one hiker, "belay" who was already there. we had been leap frogging her all day.

the top of the mountain is pretty open and as you would expect there are a number of ski runs that descend from there. day hikers were roaming around checking out the different views from each of the runs. we answered some questions about long distance hiking and eventually sat in the center of it all in the sun and had a snack.

we chatted with belay for a few minutes before heading off. i'm a little jealous of her staying in the ski patrol hut tonight as it's going to be cold again. unlike the three sided shelters, the hut is an actual building with insulation. it'll be a much warmer night for her. unfortunately with COVID, it's just not safe.

the last mile from the summit to the shelter was littered with people heading down, and a few heading up to the ski patrol hut. one guy caught up and passed us and then promptly slowed to a crawl while he peppered us with questions about hiking. i was thankful when we finally got to the blue blaze to the shelter and were able to get away from him.

we claimed the one tent pad that i knew i could get the tent to work on - the same one i used last time. again we were able to find some random rope for the fourth corner.

we grabbed all our water gear and hiked down to the water source, which is far enough that you only want to do it once. last time i was here, i hiked down to it just to check it out before hiking all the way back to get my filter and bottles.

we were alone at the shelter tonight. i imagine everyone that would have stayed here is a mile away in the patrol hut risking COVID exposure. we were able to lounge and cook on the benches and table, which was a welcome change from our normal cooking on the ground nearby.

the last time i was at this shelter it was with gumby, layla, and bria, all of whom have finished their hikes. it's strange thinking that all the folks i met and travelled with are gone from the trail. i hope they're all doing well.

i listened to a couple podcasts today, one of which had this tidbit: yelp is reporting that 60% of the businesses on their platform that closed due to COVID are now listing themselves as permanently closed. yikes.

some additional photos from today:
