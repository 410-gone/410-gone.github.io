miles: 2.0

rags was up multiple times again during the night. we think it's something in the alpine fare meals. we had a chat and decided to call for a bail out, but to return to the trail in a few days.

we got in touch with family and sent the coordinates for vt rt 11/30, then had a leisurely breakfast at the shelter before walking the 2 miles to the parking lot. we waited in the sun and ate some snacks until they arrived.

the drive home was a little sad, but we'll be back soon.
