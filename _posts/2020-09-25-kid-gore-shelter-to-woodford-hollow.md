woke up shortly after 06:00hr. packed up the tent and made breakfast. we were on trail shortly after 07:30hr.

our bear / mouse hang worked a treat.

we spent the morning hiking up glastenbury mountain, stopping at the fire tower at the top. the fog was only just starting to burn off, so the view wasn't quite as spectacular as last time, but still stunning, especially with the leaves just starting to turn.

we stopped for our 10:00hr snack and water filtration at goddard shelter where i stayed my second night on trail. three older men were still packing up. another SOBO, marilyn, showed up and we briefly chatted about footwear. he had recently aborted a PCT hike due to the fires and was unprepared for the amount of rocks and roots the east has.

we entered the glastenbury wilderness and shortly afterward rags declares, "my shorts were falling down so i tucked them into my underpants . . . that's what this sweet look is about." the bottoms of her shorts were tucked in, not the top. the bottoms.

shortly after noon we reached little pond lookout (from which you cannot see little pond) and stopped for lunch.

rags put her legs up to help drain swelling from her feet. they're doing much better today. the soaking, rolling, and removal of her insoles seems to be helping.

we kept hiking on to melville nauheim shelter, our goal for the day. the shelter had a distinct angle to it.

when we got there however, there was absolutely no water and we were both running low. we knew this was a possibility, so continued down the mountain toward rt 9, passing the split rock on the way.

after a steep and switchbacked descent, we arrived at woodford hollow, where the city stream runs near rt 9. there are some tent sites near the bridge over the river. we scoped one out and had a relaxing afternoon soaking our feet and bathing.

just as it was getting dark, marilyn showed up and gave us each a beer! allagash white! rags decided to save hers, mine is mostly gone.

this point is where i feel like i'm back on my home turf. the parking lot across the river is one i've ended hikes at before. tomorrow morning we'll be hiking up harmon hill and entering the pioneer valley.
